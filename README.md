## FAQS

#### 1. What are the steps to clone and run this boilerplate?
1.  Create a new directory on your machine: `mkdir ~/Desktop/my-app`.
2.  Open the directory using terminal: `cd my-app`.
3.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tpkahlon/npm-app-b4.git .`.
4.  Run: `yarn`.
#### 2. What if I get Administrative authentication errors?
Run following command in Terminal: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`.
#### 3. How to store additional assets indirectly related to this application?
Create a new directory with name `media` inside `app` directory. Please store any PSD, AI, EPS, DOC, TXT, PDF files here. Please use lowercase letters when storing files under `media` folder. Please use hyphens instead of underscores for longer filenames. Do not add spaces inbetween filenames.
#### 4. What steps to follow when application's coding is complete?
1.  Update Application's description in following files:
    1.  package.json
    3.  default.pug
    4.  All files under `pages` folder
2.  Remove HTML Inspector declaration inside `default.pug`. HTML Inspector is for testing purposes only and should not be included in production version.
#### 5. What additional steps to take into consideration while coding an application using this framework?
1.  Please use `https://` protocol for any third-party library/resource included in `default.pug`. Please follow this approach while importing Google fonts in `style.scss`.
2.  Please use HTTP2 `defer` or `async` attributes when you want to load scripts in document's `head`.
3.  Preload assets in the `default.pug` file. See the following link: [Mozilla: Preload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types).
#### 6. Are there any tricks to speed up development process?
Use `npm run bs` to quickly fetch and see Bootstrap SCSS variables under `app/sass` location. Use `npm run bsx` to remove that fetched file.

# Outstanding Issues
#### 1. How to download Google fonts locally for Intranet sites?
1. Offline Support is not fully supported. Fetching Google Web Fonts locally using [Gulp Google Fonts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-google-webfonts) is under testing.
